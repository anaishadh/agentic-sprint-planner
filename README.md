# Agent-Assisted Sprint Planner

This project explores how agentic AI systems can assist engineering managers
and project leads in transforming high-level client requirements into
structured sprint plans.

## What this system does
- Accepts a client problem statement
- Breaks it into actionable engineering tasks
- Estimates effort and timelines
- Allocates tasks based on team skills and availability
- Produces a human-readable sprint plan

## Why this project
Modern organizations struggle with consistent sprint planning, estimation,
and task allocation. This system demonstrates how LLM-powered agents,
coordinated via a stateful workflow, can assist in these decisions.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- LangGraph (for agent orchestration)
- Pydantic (for state management)
- LLM APIs (OpenAI / Anthropic / etc.)

## Status
🚧 Under active development
